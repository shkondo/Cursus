filter:
Allowed functions: read, strlen, malloc, calloc, realloc, free, printf, perror
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write a program that will take one and only one argument s.

Your program will then read from stdin and write all the content read in stdout
except that every occurrence of s must be replaced by '*'.

For example :

./filter bonjour
will behave the same way as:
sed 's/bonjour/*******/g'

in case of error during read or a malloc you must write "Error: " followed by
the error message in stderr and return 1.

$> echo 'abcdefgaaaabcdefabc' | ./filter abc | cat -e
***defgaaa***def***

If the program is called without argument or with an empty argument or with
multiples arguments it must return 1.
